Welcome to these 2 flashers!
One for Redmi 6 and the other one for 6A.

Going trough the flash wizard:
Note: You're seeing ido instead of cereus or cactus, because I tested this on a Redmi 3 phone. These flashers have not been tested yet.

You're going to be greeted by a introduction screen.

After you read it (or not), platform tools will get ready and drivers will install.

When your device is verified, a ROM will start downloading (the best one for custom ROMs: R6 is 11.0.4.0 and R6A is 11.0.8.0).

Flashing time! You'll get to choose if you want to wipe your data - clean all (recommended) or if you want to keep them - save user data.

The wizard will do a final verification (just if the device is connected; the flash script will check if you have the correct device too) before the flash. Flashing will start in 10 seconds.

You can either continue and delete temporary files, or keep them. You can access them by clicking Super (Win) + R on your keyboard and typing "%temp%/Sucharek".
If you proceed to delete the files, you will free up ~3.2GB of space.

Have a great time flashing!
