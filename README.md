### Going trough the flash wizard:

Note: You're seeing ido instead of cereus or cactus, because I tested this on a Redmi 3 phone. These flashers have not been tested yet.

You're going to be greeted by an introduction screen.

If you accidentally closed the program, no worries! You can resume from an action (unfinished).

After you read it (or not), platform tools will get ready and drivers will install.

If there would be any errors occurring, there are possible fixes.

Now it's time for a check.

If you don't have a Redmi 6 or Redmi 6A, the program ends there.

After your device is verified and internet connection will be checked, a ROM will start downloading (the best one for custom ROMs: R6 is 11.0.4.0 and R6A is 11.0.8.0).

After that, it will extract.

Flashing time! You'll get to choose if you want to wipe your data - clean all (recommended) or if you want to keep them - save user data.

The wizard will do a final verification (just if the device is connected; the flash script will check if you have the correct device too) before the flash. Flashing will start in 10 seconds.

And off we go! Flashing...

Finished! Your phone shouold be flashed now!

You can either continue and delete temporary files, or keep them. You can access them by clicking `Super (Win) + R` on your keyboard and typing `%temp%/Sucharek`.
If you proceed to delete the files, you will free up ~3GB of space.

That's all. I hope I made it easy to use and understandable.
Have a great time flashing!
