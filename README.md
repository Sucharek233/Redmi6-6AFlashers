### Welcome to Redmi 6/6A flashers!

Redmi 6A flash tested by [SnooDrawings5122](https://www.reddit.com/u/SnooDrawings5122) on Reddit.

Redmi 6 flash hasn't been tested yet, but should work fine. The ROM download and security checks work, so it should be good.

The progress bar at ROM download may glitch out a bit, but don't worry, it won't affect anything.

Some images may be outdated (for now, just spacing, not important).

### Going trough the flash wizard:

Note: You're seeing ido instead of cereus or cactus, because I tested this on a Redmi 3 phone. These flashers have not been tested yet.

You're going to be greeted by an introduction screen.

If you accidentally closed the program, no worries! You can resume from an action (unfinished).

After you read it (or not), platform tools will get ready and drivers will install.

If there would be any errors occurring, there are possible fixes.

Now it's time for a check.

If you don't have a Redmi 6 or Redmi 6A, the program ends there.

After your device is verified and internet connection will be checked, and you will get the chance to pick one of these options.

You can either download automatically the best MIUI versions for custom ROMs (versions displayed on image above) or you can put in your own download link.

After you make your decision, the ROM will start downloading.

After that, it will extract.

Then some additional tasks.

Flashing time! You'll get to choose if you want to wipe your data - clean all (recommended) or if you want to keep them - save user data.

The wizard will do a final verification (just if the device is connected; the flash script will check if you have the correct device too) before the flash. Flashing will start in 10 seconds.

You can either continue and delete temporary files, or keep them. You can access them by clicking `Super (Win) + R` on your keyboard and typing `%temp%/Sucharek`.
If you proceed to delete the files, you will free up ~3GB of space.

That's all. I hope I made it easy to use and understandable.
Have a great time flashing!
